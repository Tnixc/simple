# Welcome to My Blog

This is my very first blog post using the Simple build tool! I'm excited to share my thoughts and experiences with you.

## What is Simple?

Simple is a lightweight static site generator that makes it easy to build fast, modern websites. It uses:

- Components for reusable UI elements
- Templates for dynamic content
- Markdown for easy content authoring
- YAML frontmatter for metadata

## Getting Started

To create your own blog post, simply:

1. Create a new `.md` file in your `data/Posts/` directory
2. Add YAML frontmatter with your metadata
3. Write your content in Markdown
4. Add the filename to your `Posts.data.toml` file

That's it! Simple will automatically generate your blog post page.
